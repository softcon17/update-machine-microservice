# Setting up and getting started
## Installations

In order to get started, we need to insall all the required depenedencies listed in the package file, plus our test harness `mocha`. So run the following within the project folder:
```
npm install
npm install -g mocha
```
Before doing either of these you will need to ensure you have installed NodeJS server, as was indiciated in the getting started guide

## Run the App

To run the app, we need to start our file with NodeJS service:
```
node main.js
```

## Need Help

If you get stuck, either ask one of the team, or see if you can tackle the problem youself with the help of the cheatsheets conviently located in the 'cheatsheets' folder within the `getting started` repo.
